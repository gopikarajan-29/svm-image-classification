# SVM_IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
An image categorization project utilizing Python and scikit-learn that is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). Comprises feature extraction, model training, assessment, accuracy visualization, and picture preparation.

# Objectives
- Image loading and preprocessing (resizing, flattening, grayscale conversion)
- Feature extraction using pixel intensities or image descriptors
- Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Train-test split and accuracy evaluation
- Confusion matrix visualization

  # Further Improvements
 - Include PCA feature extraction
 - Use a larger, structured image dataset
 - Experiment with kernel types
 - Build a web UI for uploading and classifying images
